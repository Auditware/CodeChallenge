# Audit Wizard Find the Bug Challenge #1 - "Hey, can I borrow your NFT?"

Audit Wizard Find the bug challenges test your smart contract security and solidity knowledge. Unlike simple code snippet challenges, Audit Wizard challenges present you with a fully functional contract that has a security vulnerability. It is up to you to figure out where the bug is and submit your answer using the "Submit Answer" Button.


Correctly finding the bug will unlock a commemorative badge in Audit Wizard. Participate in each challenge to build your collection!

This challenge includes an NFT (ERC-721) borrowing/lending system. Lenders can stake their NFTs and set a collatoral amout that borrowers must stake with the contract before they can borrow that NFT. Borrowers pay a portion of that stake as rent to the lender, based on how long they hold the NFT. NFTs can be returned by borrowers to retrieve their remaining collatoral.



Wizards have heard whispers that this contract is insecure. You've been tasked with uncovering the vulnerability. Find it, and the wizards will surely appreciate your skills.



Happy hunting!
